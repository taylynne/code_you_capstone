# Code:You Capstone Project

I chose to look at weather data for my capstone project. I did this because our summers have become hotter, we have had more and more tornadoes in our region, and lots more extreme weather. While I know the weather and our atmosphere is changing due to pollution and other factors, I wanted to look at exactly how much things are actually changing. I constantly feel like things are so much x or y compared to when I was a kid; but I always wonder if it's just because I'm seeing more details now than I was when I was younger. So I'm curious if things are actually that much different from what I remember as a kid. I picked Lexington, KY to look at, because it's fairly central to Kentucky, it's one of the larger cities, and there's more data available. If I progress pretty well with the Lexington data, I may pull data from Louisville and/or Danville as well. But I do not want the data to become too overwhelming or too broad. For now, I'll be sticking with Lexington.

## Data

I collected all of my data from NOAA; I refined my initial search for data for a smaller range of data from 2000 - 2025. I would like to use this dataset to look at more recent current trends, and maybe try to hypothsis how the weather for the rest of the year may be. I then searched for more historical data: anything prior to 2000. There is a huge range of data here. I would like to perhaps isolate certain years to just give a basic trend of weather, and maybe consider the coldest/hottest day (and how the rest of the year looks compared to other years?)
