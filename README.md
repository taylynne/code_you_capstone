# Code:You Capstone Project

For my capstone project, I would like to look at book genre data and sales.  My backup depending on how finding data goes will be for rabies data.  I worked animal control, and rabies is a big part of community safety with animals.  

My goals:
- [ ] Collect Data pertaining to books, preferring data from within the past few years
- [ ] Refine the data, and narrow the scope down.
- [ ] Compare genres & sub-genres as well as self published book
- [ ] See what genres and sub-genres have become popular more recently 
	- are they 'new' genres or just recently popular? 
	- increase in number of books written? 
	- increase in number of reviews?
- [ ] 
- [ ] Create graphs & a tableau dashboard that tells a story of what I find in the data

## Data

I have found some datasets that already have a lot of information.  However, there's some data I would like that is not in the sets.  I may see about collecting the data myself after I narrow down the data to a smaller set.  There are some APIs that allow me to pull book specific data, so I may go that route in order to find out: publisher information, if publishers have changed, and potentially consider kindle unlimited as a factor for popularity of books.
